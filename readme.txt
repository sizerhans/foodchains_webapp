To test this code:



1. make sure you are in the foodchains directory. 
    run parcel build
2. make sure you have node and npm installed.
3. run 'npm start' to start the web app on your local server
4. open the localhost site, the console should give you the address and port to use e.g. http://localhost:1234
5. This app was designed for mobiles. Go into your browser's development (CTRL + SHIFT + I) console and change your browser view to mobile. For Google chrome you hit the toggle device button. 

This is a website to demonstrate the foodchains app concept, it is not finished, as it does not allow you to post your picture and get a card in response.
